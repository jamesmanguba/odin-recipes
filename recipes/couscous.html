    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The one pan dinner fad maybe came and went but it’s still totally my thing! This One Pan Moroccan Chicken and Couscous is one of my favorite one pan dinners to date! It has a delicious blend of flavors and textures, it’s a healthy dinner, and it’s brimming with those irresistible deliciously spiced Moroccan flavors.</p>

            <li>Add chicken to pan season with salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp coriander and 1/4 cinnamon. Cook, turning occasionally, until cooked through, about 7 minutes. </li>

            <li>Add in chicken broth and apricots, season with salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil (it shouldn't just simmer on the edges it should boil lightly in the center as well). </li>

            <li>Stir in chicken and any accumulated juices, lemon juice, almonds, cilantro and mint (you can also add in little more broth if desired). Serve warm.</li>
